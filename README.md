# Preeclampsia Risk Classification using Machine Learning

This project develops a machine learning classification model for maternal risk assessment using the UCI Maternal Health Risk dataset and evaluates cross-dataset generalization on a Kaggle maternal dataset.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- ROC-AUC

## Key Findings
- High internal performance on UCI dataset (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.97)
- Significant performance drop on external dataset, highlighting domain shift challenges.

## Note
Datasets are not included in this repository.
